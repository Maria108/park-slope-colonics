              Elena Bykova is a certified colon hydrotherapist, a certified
              holistic nutritionist, and the founder of Park Slope Colonics.
              Elenaâ€™s journey began in her early twenties when she started
              working at a colonic center and witnessed firsthand the remarkable
              transformations clients achieved with gravity-method colonics.
              This experience inspired her to become certified and dedicate
              herself to the practice of colon hygiene, both for herself and for
              her clients. Since becoming a therapist in 2014, Elena has
              performed over 1,000 colonics annually, helping clients reach
              optimal digestive health. She is deeply passionate about the role
              of digestive health in overall well-being and sees the tremendous
              impact colonics can have on enhancing the digestive system and
              promoting lasting health.
